Introduction to the Project
</h1>

This project explores the **British Library’s bibliographic dataset of digitized British dramas from the 17th–19th centuries**, using an **exploratory distant reading** approach.  

The workflow of this notebook proceeds in three stages:  

1. **Descriptive Statistics and Visualization of the Dataset**  
   Provides a structured overview of the dataset for both the researcher and the reader, helping understand dataset size, structure and suitability for further analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis on Comedy Subdataset**  
   Investigateso examine temporal trends in publications, spatial networks of publishing locations, authorship distribution, and lexical patterns of comedy titles.

3. **Text Mining and Network Analysis**  
   Constructs a **syntactic dependency network** of frequent lemmas in comedy titles to address the central research question:  

   > **How do 17th–19th century British comedy titles encode gendered roles and archetypes, and what do they reveal about the social expectations of the period?**
